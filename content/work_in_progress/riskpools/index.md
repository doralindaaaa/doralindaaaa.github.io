We study public policy proposals that would decouple health risk
pools from employment pools in the US. These policies, such as ‘Medicare for
All,’ would pool health risk at the state or national level, overturning the
status quo of pooling risks at the firm level. Generally speaking, firms
with on average healthy employees would be worse off, and firms with on average
sick employees would be better off, but little is known about the extent of
existing variation along this dimens ion. We analyze a large, national data set of individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance and present novel evidence on the variation in average health spending across firms.

We study public policy proposals that would decouple health risk pools from employment pools in the US. These policies, such as ‘Medicare for All,’ would pool health risk at the state or national level, overturning the status quo of pooling at the firm level. Generally speaking, firms with on average healthy employees would be worse off, and firms with on average sick employees would be better off. We analyze a large, national data set of individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance and present novel evidence on the variation in average health spending across firms. We find that {55} percent of firms (representing {38} percent of individuals) have average health spending that is below the national average. We also find that {9} ({2}) percent of firms have average health spending that is two times lower (higher) than the national average, suggesting that big winners and big losers would exist. We then construct the joint distribution of firms’ average health spending and average income and find that pooling health risk across firms would on net be regressive, distributing {4} percent of total healthcare spending from the highest to the lowest income quartile.
